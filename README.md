Email Filter
A simple function that filters emails based on the sentence's contents. It checks if the sentence contains the words "share" and "email". If it does, it returns either "Student has shared" or "Student wants to know if can share".

How to use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in Visual Studio.
Run the solution.
To use the function in your own code, simply call Program.FilterEmail(sentence) where sentence is the string you want to filter.
Note
The function only checks for the words "share" and "email" in the sentence, so it may not be able to accurately filter all emails. This is a basic implementation and can be improved further.
